## WIP

# Transcendence
The goal of this project is to develop a web application that lets clients play the infamous pong game.
Minimal requirements can be seen in the subject.pdf file. 
Apart from that we are able to choose between many modules to refine our project and engage in our specific interests.

For now working on the synchronization of the remote players with the Django Backend on the Django development server.

Proper frontend, styling etc. to come....
